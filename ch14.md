# When Trouble Strikes!

## Ruby Debugger
 - Does it work for Ruby 2.1 as well?

## Interactive Ruby
 - IRB subsessions (!!1)
 - `'<,'>!ruby` and `!'<,'>w !ruby`

## But it doesn't work
  - The `-w` option - does it really help finding missing `end` keywords.
  - Forgetting comma in print
  - Setters' receiver is not implicit in Ruby.
  - `{}` and `do; end;` precedence.
  - de-buffling STDOUT/STDERR with sync=true
  - Hash#rehash
  - Catching bastards with Object#freeze

## But it's too slow

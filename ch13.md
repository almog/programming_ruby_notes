# Unit Testing
- Numeric#divmod example: `42.0.divmod 5 #=> [8, 2.0]`.
- MiniTest::Unit vs Test::Unit
- Even when you require 'test/unit', it uses MiniTest's compatibilty layer.
- Assertion's optional last parameter is a message to precede a failure. It is mostly useful with `refute_nil`

##Structuring tests
- A test case is a class that must subclass Test::Unit::TestCase.
- A test method name _must_ start with `test`
- The DBI class.
- The `setup` and `teardown` are ran before and after _each_ test method.
- Inside the `teardown` `passed?` returns true iff the test passed.

## Organizing and Running Tests
- `ruby test_roman.rb -n /range/` runs all test methods whose name matches /range/. if a string literal rather than regexp is passed to `-n`, it implies an exact match.
- `ruby -I /add/me/to/your/load/path test/case.rb` does what you think it does
- Let's stress the point about how to run your test.

## Test Suites
- Organizing your test-cases in groups of mini-test suites that are goruped into a mega test suite
- The two naming conventions for test suites files are: ts\_xxx and test\_xxx.

## RSpec and Shoulda
- `describe` arity isn't 1.



## Test::Unit assertions
- `is_a?` and `kind_of?` are synonymous and are different than `instance_of`

## From [minitest's readme](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest)
- singleton method:
```
  def obj_under_test.fake_method
    ...
  end
```

- Minitest's features/problems:
  * minitest/autorun - the easy and explicit way to run all your tests.
  * minitest/unit - a very fast, simple, and clean test system.
  * minitest/spec - a very fast, simple, and clean spec system.
  * minitest/mock - a simple and clean mock/stub system.
  * minitest/benchmark - an awesome way to assert your algorithm's performance.
  * minitest/pride - show your pride in testing!
  * Incredibly small and fast runner, but no bells and whistles.
